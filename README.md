Charts is a tool for OpenWebUI that allows you to create charts using the Chart.js cdn. The tool will embed the resulting chart directly into the chat using the RichUI functions implemented in openwebui 0.6.3.x.

# INSTALL
Copy the contents of chart.py into a new User Tool and save. Take a look at Valves; you can easily customize the graphical output.

# USAGE
Try one of these prompts in chat:
- "Make me a chart of the 10 most populous cities in the world"
- "Make me a chart using Charts of this data [paste data here]"

In the top right graph, there is a theme toggle and a download button to download a PNG.
